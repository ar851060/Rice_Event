Estimate the impact to NTUT search by rice event with lots of causal inference method

At 9 July 2023, there are lots of media reports the rice event in Taiwan. 
The rice event is that a group of students from National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT)  went to a resteraunt to had a dinner.
However, the amounts of meals were not enough for those students, so they rated the bad comment in Google map after finishing the dinner.
The owner of that resteraunt thought those comments were not fair to him, so he decided to tell this thing to the media.

The detail can be seen in these websites (they are all in traditional chinese):

Here, I use three methods to estimate the impact of rice event to the search value of NTUT in Google trend.
The methods I use are Regression Kink Design (RKD), Difference-in-Difference (DID), Sythetic Control. 
Also, I try to explain that why National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) is NOT a good control group in DID.
